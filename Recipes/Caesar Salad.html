    <h1>Ceaser Salad Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Caesar Salad Dressing</h2>
    <p>
        1 cup mayonnaise<br>
        ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>
        2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br>
        2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br>
        1 garlic clove, grated<br>
        1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce*<br>
        Pinch sea salt<br>
        Freshly ground black pepper<br>
        ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese*
    </p>
    <h2>For the Salad</h2>
    <p>
        1 pound romaine lettuce, about 2 medium heads, chopped or torn into bite-size pieces<br>
        ½ cup shaved Parmesan cheese*<br>
        Freshly ground black pepper
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Make the croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the bread cubes on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat. Spread evenly on the baking sheet and bake for 10 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.<br>
        Make the dressing: In a large liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and several grinds of pepper until smooth. Stir in the cheese and season to taste. If the dressing is too thick, stir in water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.<br>
        Assemble the salad: Place the lettuce in a large bowl. Add half the dressing, half the croutons, and half the cheese and toss to coat. Add more dressing as desired, tossing until the salad is coated to your liking. Season to taste and top with the remaining croutons, remaining cheese, and several grinds of pepper.
